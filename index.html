    My Parents call me Tanmay,<br>

And it is registered on my death certificate as...<br>

Oh sorry, on my birth certificate as Tanmay Narendra Chandane.<br>

I don’t know what people think of me. So, what I can say is only “I DON’T CARE”, would you mind it? Again, I Don’t Care!<br>

I am a Harmless Creature (until all my hormones work properly). I take a little bit of time to adjust with anyone.<br>

I don’t underestimate anyone. And I can forgive the person who kills me, but not the one who misused me.<br>

Now, I know, you are thinking, what the hell this person might be of use?<br>

The answer is, I don’t know. But still I hate people who misuse me…<br>

Now, just leave it.<br>

I love to live with my friends, and for friendship, I don’t consider their any previous achievements.<br>

I love all those who feel comfortable with me and who make me feel comfortable with them.<br>

I believe in GOD. I am optimistic. I always think positive. Which has never helped me to achieve anything, but still it has become a habit. I forgive people soon, as I feel this life as too short and have no time to keep on proving others as wrong and us only the perfect!<br>

I love innovative things. One thing I have observed about me is, I don’t go behind famous people. As it would be an extra burden to them. "I don’t like to disturb anyone" I enjoy the company of people who are free. I too love to live freely!<br>

I believe that people won’t understand the importance of the other person until that person is found dead. And I am not an important person, can you guess why?<br>

Because I am still alive...
